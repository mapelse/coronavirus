Track Coronavirus Spread
This interactive world map aims to track the global spread of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, inspired by the popular map produced by researchers at Johns Hopkins CSSE. Daily updated data is also provided by John Hopkin's researchers.

There are 3 different layers. First "Confirmed Cases" shows the cumulative number of infected people at those locations. Second one "Deaths" indicates cumulative number of deaths caused by this disease. Lastly, the layer "Recover" denotes the cumulative number of people who got recovered.

How to use the map
Labels inside the circles represents the cumulative number of people. Click on radio-buttons on top-right corner to switch between layers. In order to open popup windows with more details such as name of location, date of data.
